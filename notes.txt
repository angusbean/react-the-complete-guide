 -- Create React App
 npx create-react-app {app-name}
 cd {app-name}
 npm start

 -- Using Exsisting project
 npm install    // to download the dependancies in package.json
 npm start      // to start the application

-- Project Overview
src/index.js is the insertion file run by the app
public/index.html is the HTML file for the single page application
    div id="root" is the targeted HTML element by the React app
src/App.js is React application file, the root component
    App is a component (function) which is exported from the App.js filter

-- JSX
JSX = JavaScriptXML, because HTML is XML
Allows use of HTML type Syntax in JavaScript files

-- React Components
React component are functions that return JSX code
Use uppercase starting functions for custom made objects/functions
React Components can only return one root element i.e. a div that contains all elements
'cntl' + 'shift' + 'i' in vs code auto formats the document
Apply CSS classes with the tag className="" instead of classes
use {} to insert dynamic components, function or other js expressions
React components end with an export statement, the use of default sets the standard return if there are multiple

-- Passing Data via Props
pass the 'props' key word into the component function then you insert as dynmanic components
for example the React Component is used with passed values (properties)    
<ExpenseItem 
    title={expenses[0].title}
</ExpenseItem>
then in the component the property is referenced as the below
<h2>{props.title}</h2>
data can be passed through multiple layers of props to subcomponents

-- Composition (children props)
Composition rendering a user interface from multiple components
Can create custome HTML componets and like custom divs by creating them and passing props.children
<div className="card">{props.children}</div> // is a custom div with its own css
to use the css properties of both the custom class and pass the underlying classes use
const classes = 'card ' + props.className; // pass this into the className of the custom component
// make sure to remember white space between card and the + in the ''
